Each investment generates 15% (or 12%) of profit, which must be renewed within a valid time. Once the investment is postponed, profits will be greatly reduced. Therefore, timely renewal is a very important investment action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nManual renewal<br>\r\n1. Before getting investment income, players need to make a new renewal. For example, after the first phase of investment, the principal plus profit will be returned after the fourth phase is successful. Before the end of the fourth phase, the user needs to renew the investment first, that is, the manual renewal can be performed between the first to the fourth phase; <br>\r\n2. The renewal investment amount can be greater than or equal to the investment amount of the previous period, but not less than;<br>\r\n3. You can manually enter the renewal amount that meets the investment range of the period;<br>\r\n4. The user can switch between manual renewal and automatic renewal in the smart chip list;<br>\r\n5. Deferred renewal: If you choose not to renew or forget to renew, the total income will remain in the contract fund pool until the player uses the renewal function. When the deferred investment is settled in the corresponding period, the standard investment can still get 5% of the profit and principal, and the sub-investment can get 2% of the profit and principal (that is, the profit of the deferred investment is less than the profit of the effective renewal 10%). The player’s investment in this postponed renewal of investment can normally generate 15% (or 12%) of profit and principal return within the specified number of periods;<br>\r\n6. If the player does not want to choose to continue casting, he can click the recovery function. Once recovered, no investment profit will be generated. After the end of the period in which the recovery is located, the invested principal (no profit) after two periods will be returned to the user account balance after deducting 5% of the management fee;<br>\r\n7. Players can reinvest manually after the current period, the current period and the next three periods of smart financing, that is, before the end of the fourth period. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAutomatic renewal<br>\r\n1. After enabling this function, the system will automatically renew the investment for the player after two periods, and the account balance will be automatically deducted by the same amount as the last investment. The player must ensure that there is enough money in the balance to ensure automatic renewal Success; <br>\r\n2. If the balance is insufficient, the total profit from the previous time will remain in the contract fund pool until the player uses the manual renewal function in the smart chip list (which is a deferred renewal). When the deferred investment is settled in the corresponding period, the standard investment can still get 5% of the profit and principal, and the sub-investment can get 2% of the profit and principal (that is, the profit of the deferred investment is less than the profit of the effective renewal 10%). The player’s investment in this postponed renewal can normally generate 15% (or 12%) of profit and principal return within the specified number of periods;<br>\r\n3. If the automatic renewal function is used together, it is recommended that the investor keep at least 2 times the investment amount in the wallet balance for the first time.

Investors who have confidence in the future of smart chip can find the angel investor section in DAPP and apply for participation. Angel investors need to have enough understanding of smart chip and be willing to support and promote him. Angel investors' funds will be used for technology research and development and market application development. For angel investors to pay money and efforts, smart chip will also give a very generous return.<br>\r\n\r\n1. A total of 52 angel investors are set up, and 78 dividend rights are set up;<br>\r\n2. Each angel investor needs to invest 5000U and obtain one dividend right, the amount of which is included in the technology copyright fee, which also destroys the AMB token with the value of 5000U;<br>\r\n3. Angel investors can obtain four rights and interests:<br>\r\n    The first direct promotion to V6: the dynamic market award is directly upgraded to VIP6 level, which originally requires a cumulative flow performance of 1.5 million U, which can obtain 3.6% of the new flow performance. ;<br>\r\n4.  The second bonus bonus: you can get the bonus of each period of token bonus pool. There are 78 dividends in total, and angel investors get the corresponding number of dividends. When the current period of intelligent financing is successful and settled, the dividends will be distributed, and the unfinished part will be deposited to the next period;<br>\r\n5.  The third recommendation Award: AMB token award. When the smart chip is completely successful, i.e. the token is destroyed to 21 million pieces, all angel investors can obtain 3% of the total amount of tokens, and the number is divided equally according to the number of effective angel investors;<br>\r\n6.  The fourth recommendation reward: recommend other angel investors to get the number of shares. When angel investors recommend one angel investor, they can get 0.5 shares, and more promotion is more; for every 3 angel investors recommended by angel investors, the VIP level will be automatically upgraded by one level, and more promotion will be made; if non angel investors recommend angel investors, they can also get 0.5 dividend rights, pushing more and more, but they can't get VIP6 and token rewards.<br>\r\n7. Last place evaluation system: after the success of each phase of intelligent financing, the angel investor ranking the last in the market performance will be given a half of the amount of dividends

The total contract fund pool is the total amount of accounts of all users, including investment amount, account balance, profit, bonus and other funds. At the same time, the investor's profit and principal are transferred back to the investor from the wallet address of the total contract capital pool through the smart contract. The contract address is open and transparent, and the total capital and capital in and out records can be checked at any time. It is completely controlled by the smart contract, which avoids the uncertain factors of human control and ensures the interests of investors.
