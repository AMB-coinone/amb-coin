Therefore, timely renewal is a very important investment action. <br>\n<br>\nManual renewal<br>\n1. Before getting investment income, players need to make a new renewal. For example, after the first phase of investment, the principal plus profit will be returned after the fourth phase is successful. Before the end of the fourth phase, the user needs to renew the investment first, that is, the manual renewal can be performed between the first to the fourth phase; <br>\n2. The renewal investment amount can be greater than or equal to the investment amount of the previous period, but not less than;<br>\n3. You can manually enter the renewal amount that meets the investment range of the period;<br>\n4. The user can switch between manual renewal and automatic renewal in the smart chip list;<br>\n5. Deferred renewal: If you choose not to renew or forget to renew, the total income will remain in the contract fund pool until the player uses the renewal function. When the deferred investment is settled in the corresponding period, the standard investment can still get 5% of the profit and principal, and the sub-investment can get 2% of the profit and principal (that is, the profit of the deferred investment is less than the profit of the effective renewal 10%). The player’s investment in this postponed renewal of investment can normally generate 15% (or 12%) of profit and principal return within the specified number of periods;<br>\n6. If the player does not want to choose to continue casting, he can click the recovery function. Once recovered, no investment profit will be generated. After the end of the period in which the recovery is located, the invested principal (no profit) after two periods will be returned to the user account balance after deducting 5% of the management fee;<br>\n7. Players can reinvest manually after the current period, the current period and the next three periods of smart financing, that is, before the end of the fourth period. <br>\n<br>\nAutomatic renewal<br>\n1. After enabling this function, the system will automatically renew the investment for the player after two periods, and the account balance will be automatically deducted by the same amount as the last investment. The player must ensure that there is enough money in the balance to ensure automatic renewal Success; <br>\n2. If the balance is insufficient, the total profit from the previous time will remain in the contract fund pool until the player uses the manual renewal function in the smart chip list (which is a deferred renewal). When the deferred investment is settled in the corresponding period, the standard investment can still get 5% of the profit and principal, and the sub-investment can get 2% of the profit and principal (that is, the profit of the deferred investment is less than the profit of the effective renewal 10%). The player’s investment in this postponed renewal can normally generate 15% (or 12%) of profit and principal return within the specified number of periods;<br>\n3. If the automatic renewal function is used together, it is recommended that the investor keep at least 2 times the investment amount in the wallet balance for the first time. After that, the system will automatically cycle for investors to automatically invest and return. It is a very convenient smart financial management solution . <br>\n<br>\nGlossary: ​​<br>\nSmart chip target 1%: refers to the maximum investment amount that the user can participate in the current period automatically input after clicking, the value is 1% of the total amount of the smart chip target (35% increments per period);<br>\n<br>\nStandard investment minimum: refers to the minimum value of the current standard investment range that users can participate in after clicking;<br>\n<br>\nStandard investment scope:<br>\nPhase 1-Phase 10, the investment amount is 10U~1% (1% of the total smart fund target amount in each phase);<br>\n11 periods -20 periods, the investment amount is 100U~1%;<br>\n21 periods -30 periods, the investment amount is 1000U~1%;<br>\nPhase 31-Phase 35, the investment amount is 3000U~1%;<br>\n36 periods -40 periods, the investment amount is 5000U~1%;<br>\nAfter the 41st period, the investment amount is 10000U~1%;<br>\n<br>\nSame as last investment amount: refers to automatically input the user's last equivalent investment amount after clicking;<br>\n      </div>\n      <div v-else>\n        续投是AMB智筹内非常重要的功能，每期投资产生15%（或12%）的利润，必须在有效时间内进行续投才可获得。一旦延期续投，利润将大打折扣。所以及时续投是非常重要的投资动作。<br>\n<br>\n手动续投<br>\n1.  获得投资收益前，玩家需要先进行新一期续投。比如第一期投资后，第四期成功后将返还本金加利润，在第四期结束之前，用户需要先进行续投，即第一期至第四期之间都可以进行手动续投；<br>\n2.  续投金额可以大于等于上一期投资金额，不可小于；<br>\n3.  可手动输入符合该期投资区间的续投金额；<br>\n4.  用户可以在智筹明细列表内切换手动续投和自动续投的类型；<br>\n5.  延期续投：如果选择不进行续投或忘记续投，该收益总额将留在合约资金池内，直到玩家使用续投功能。延期续投在对应的期数结算时，标准投资仍可获得5%的利润与本金，次级投资可获得2%的利润与本金（即延期续投的利润比有效续投的利润减少10%）。玩家本次延期续投的投资额，则可在规定期数时正常产生15%（或12%）的利润及本金返还；<br>\n6.  如果玩家没有意愿选择继续续投，可以点击回收功能，一旦回收将不会产生任何投资利润。在回收时所在的期数结束后，间隔两期后将投资的本金（无利润），扣除5%的管理费，返回至用户账户余额内；<br>\n7.  玩家可以在投资本期之后，本期与接下来的三期智筹时间内，即在第四期结束之前进行手动续投都视为有效续投。<br>\n<br>\n自动续投<br>\n1.  启用该功能后，系统将隔两期之后自动为玩家进行续投，账户余额将自动扣除与上一次投资相同的金额，玩家须在余额内保证留有足够的金额，以确保自动续投成功；<br>\n2.  如果余额不足，上一次的收益总额将留在合约资金池内，直到玩家在智筹明细列表中使用手动续投功能（属于延期续投）。延期续投在对应的期数结算时，标准投资仍可获得5%的利润与本金，次级投资可获得2%的利润与本金（即延期续投的利润比有效续投的利润减少10%）。玩家本次延期续投的投资额，则可在规定期数时正常产生15%（或12%）的利润及本金返还；<br>\n3.  如果配合使用自动续投功能，建议第一次投资者在钱包余额内留够至少2倍投资额，此后系统将自动循环为投资者自动投资和收益，是一种非常方便的智能理财方案。<br>\n<br>\n名词解释：<br>\n智筹目标1% ：是指点击后自动输入用户可以参与的本期最大投资额，数值为每期智筹目标（每期35%递增）总金额的1%；<br>\n<br>\n标准投资最低额：是指点击后自动输入用户可以参与的本期标准投资额范围的最小值；<br>\n<br>\n标准投资范围：<br>\n1期 -10期，  投资额10U~1%（每期总智筹目标金额的1%）；<br>\n11期 -20期，投资额100U~1%；<br>\n21期 -30期，投资额1000U~1%；<br>\n31期 -35期，投资额3000U~1%；<br>\n36期 -40期，投资额5000U~1%；<br>\n41期以后，  投资额10000U~1%；<br>\n<br>\n同上次投资额：是指点击后自动输入用户上一次相等的投资额；<br>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n
